Let's calculate smth with expression given:
\[{{y}\cdot{{3.000}\cdot{x}}}\]
BRITISH SCIENTISTS WERE SHOCKED, WHEN THEY COUNT THIS EXPRESSION IN THE POINT (y = 2.000000, x = 1.000000)...

IT'S VALUE = 6.000000 !!!


Calculating the 1 derivation of the expression:

1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{{y}\cdot{{3.000}\cdot{x}}}\]
1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{{3.000}\cdot{x}}\]
1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{x}\]
here it is:
\[{1.000}\]
2 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{3.000}\]
here it is:
\[{0.000}\]
here it is:
\[{3.000}\]
4 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{y}\]
here it is:
\[{1.000}\]
here it is:
\[{{{3.000}\cdot{x}}+{{3.000}\cdot{y}}}\]
Calculating the 2 derivation of the expression:

1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{{{3.000}\cdot{x}}+{{3.000}\cdot{y}}}\]
1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{{3.000}\cdot{y}}\]
1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{y}\]
here it is:
\[{1.000}\]
2 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{3.000}\]
here it is:
\[{0.000}\]
here it is:
\[{3.000}\]
4 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{{3.000}\cdot{x}}\]
4 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{x}\]
here it is:
\[{1.000}\]
5 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{3.000}\]
here it is:
\[{0.000}\]
here it is:
\[{3.000}\]
here it is:
\[{6.000}\]
Calculating the 3 derivation of the expression:

1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{6.000}\]
here it is:
\[{0.000}\]
Calculating the 4 derivation of the expression:

1 step:
finding a derivation of function:
\[{0.000}\]
here it is:
\[{0.000}\]
Finally... The 4 derivation of the expression:
\[{0.000}\]
BRITISH SCIENTISTS WERE SHOCKED, WHEN THEY COUNT THE 4 DERIVATION OF THIS EXPRESSION IN THE POINT (y = 2.000000, x = 1.000000)...

IT'S VALUE = 0.000000 !!!
